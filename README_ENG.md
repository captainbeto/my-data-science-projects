# My Data Science Projects 📊

Welcome to my Data Science projects repository. In this repository, you will find a series of projects I have worked on during my learning journey in Data Science, applying different techniques and methodologies that include exploratory data analysis, machine learning, time series analysis, natural language processing, and more.

## Objective 🎯

The aim of this repository is to showcase my progress and learning in the field of Data Science, as well as share solutions to real-world problems with a practical and technical approach. Each project is designed to integrate various Data Science tools and techniques, such as:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** 🔎
- **Data Analysis and Visualization** 📈
- **Machine Learning** 🤖
- **Deep Learning** 🧠
- **Time Series** ⏳
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** 💬
- **Recommendation Systems** 💡

## Projects (WIP)

Below is a list of the available projects in this repository:

1. **[Project Name](project-directory/README.md)**:
   Project description

## Repository Structure 📂

Each folder contains an independent project with its own set of notebooks, source code, data (if available), and result files.

## How to Run the Projects 🖥️

Each project has a `README.md` file with specific instructions on how to run the notebooks, train models, and visualize results.

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sofiavalino/my-data-science-projects.git

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd <nombre-de-proyecto>

3. **Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-<nombre-de-proyecto>.txt
   
4. **Open the notebooks in Jupyter or your IDE of choice:**

    Once the dependencies are installed, open the notebooks located in the Notebooks folder to start working with the data and models. You can also use any other IDE you prefer, such as [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), si así lo deseas., if you wish.

## Last but not least: My Blog =^._.^= 📚

In addition to the projects in this repository, I also share my college notes and topics related to Data Science and Computer Science on my blog. There, you will find content on the subjects I study, as well as details about the projects I work on and other areas of interest.
